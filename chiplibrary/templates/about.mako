<p>For some unexpected reason, you're here.  If curiosity got the best of you, this is basically an idea that I have been wanting to work on for a while, but time has never permitted for me.  chiplibrary is basically a comprehensive index of all battle chips from the Mega Man Battle Network series.</p>

<p>Eventually, with the development of MMBNO coming along further into playability, I would like this programming effort to be more than an index or place of reference, and more of a resource for people who enjoyed the competitive aspect of MMBN but are unable to fulfill it due to the lack of one central resource for it all.  If any of this sounds at all interesting to you, then you are definitely in the right place, and I urge you to take a look around.</p>

<p>As of right now, the index itself is in the <acronym title="Work-in-Progress">WIP</acronym> stages right now, and it's chugging along slowly.  If you're a developer and you're into coding, the <a href="http://github.com/chrisrsantiago/chiplibrary">source code</a> for all of this is readily available.</p>
